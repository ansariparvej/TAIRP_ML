# Tech-A-Intern: Machine Learning Internship

## Information Related to Completed Projects:


## Tasks: Level 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task_1 - Image Captioning

### Problem Statement:

- Create a model that can generate descriptive captions for images. 
- This project involves combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques. 
- You'll need a dataset that contains images and their corresponding captions. 
- Preprocess the images using techniques like transfer learning with pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract image features. 
- Then, use a recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTM or GRU to generate captions based on the extracted features.

## Task_3 - Movie Recommender System

### Problem Statement:

- Create a movie recommender system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past viewing history. 
- Use collaborative filtering techniques, such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering, to make movie recommendations. 
- Experiment with matrix factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS). 
- Evaluate the system using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
